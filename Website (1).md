	My site will be a job page, with a brief description of myself and the positions I’m looking for, an “about me” page that goes into detail about my personality and work interests, and a portfolio page with my resume and a link to download a presentation with my work samples. All three of these pages will have a footer with contact information, which is just my work email and my LinkedIn profile. With this website, I hope employers will have an easy time navigating my site, learn a little bit about me, and be able to access my work samples. I wanted to keep the site very clean and simple, but I made the background pink to show more of my personality. I’m hoping to apply and land a job in fashion and/or beauty marketing, so I’m hoping my simple, sleek, and pink website will make me a more attractive candidate for those kinds of positions.
