            <p>Hello! My name is Cammy Hyde and I'm looking to expand my career in marketing, social media management, and digital media creation. I am actively searching for positions in the New York/ New Jersey area! 
                I currently attend the University of Pittsburgh, set to graduate in 2025. In my time at school I had several internship/work experiences like being a Marketing Assistant at The Pitt News, a Digital Media & Outreach Intern at Protect PT, and a Peer Speaking Coach with the Oral Communication Lab at Pitt. Additionally, I was an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant with Dr. Lester Olson for the course Rhetoric of Human Rights and I was a member of Psi Chi International Honor Society at Pitt. Outside of school, I worked as a Host at Barcelona Wine Bar in Pittsburgh. I am eternally grateful for these experiences because they helped me find my true passion and directed me on the path my professional career is on today!
                I have always been a fast learner, an avid writer, and a creative mind. In my time at school, I've had the privilege of combining all these qualities and translating this into my career. I hope to be able to pursue these creative pursuits on a higher level, learning even more about the world of digital media marketing and brand advertising.</p>
