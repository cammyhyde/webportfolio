	My site will be a job page, with a brief description of myself and the positions I’m looking for, my resume, several work samples, and a contact page. On the site, I’m thinking of making five pages. The first one will be an “About Me” page with a small biography, the second one will be a “Resume” page with a PDF of my resume and references at the bottom, the third will be my “Digital Media” page. This page will include all the digital media I’ve created at my jobs, internships, and classes, organized into subfolders of each place of work. The next page will be a “Writing” page with any writing samples I see fit to include. Finally, I will have a contact page with another picture of me and my contact information, which will include a work email address and my linkedin profile. I want this site to be very simple, clean, and user-friendly.
