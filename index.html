            <p> Cameron Hyde is a senior at the University of Pittsburgh pursuing a B.A in Communication, a B.S in Psychology, and a certificate in Corporate Community Relations.
                She works with the Marketing and Sports Marketing teams as a marketing assistant. In the summer of 2024, she worked with ProtectPT, an environmental non-profit organization, as a digital media and outreach intern. 
                These experiences gave her experience in brand advertising, digital media creation, and the vital insight to market analysis and business strategy only hands-on experience can provide. She will graduate in May 2025. 
                She is actively searching for a full-time position in the New York/New Jersey area and is interested in marketing, social media management, and consulting.
